node-game-server-express

DIARY

-----------------------
After tinkering all day and finally getting some basic things working with
mongoDB I am now at the point where I need to display dynamically generated
HTML. For this I will require an HTML templating library and at this point I
have decided to make the full jump to express.

Very little has been done on this version so far - the main work was done on
node-game-server.

-------------------------
I am reverting to the previous codebase and using:
* Mongoose (mu)
* Mustache

Because I think it will be simpler. I will revert to express at a later point
if I think it is required.
